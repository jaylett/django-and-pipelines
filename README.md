## In more detail

For each one, we're looking to build a simple pipeline that maybe compiles some scss and some coffeescript (or something like that; that's just really common in examples, so is probably easier when looking at a tool you don't know!) and outputs the files with revision/hashing, plus a manifest file that provides the mapping for those hashes.

Each one should be added as a subdirectory in this repo. It should become a little more obvious once we have the first one in there :-)
