# Let's find some examples

Just add your name next to the thing you're looking at, possibly adding it at the same time.

 * gulp (ghickman)
 * Sprockets 
 * Webpack (rosco77)
 * browserify (*rbarrois*)
 * sigh (takis)
 * [broccoli](brocolli) (*jaylett*)
 * sbt-web (Scala)
 * asset-pipeline (Grails-ish) (*jaylett*)

## In more detail

For each one, we're looking to build a simple pipeline that maybe compiles some scss and some coffeescript (or something like that; that's just really common in examples, so is probably easier when looking at a tool you don't know!) and outputs the files with revision/hashing, plus a manifest file that provides the mapping for those hashes.

Each one should be added as a subdirectory in this repo. It should become a little more obvious once we have the first one in there :-)
